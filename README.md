# Job-Parser

A simple Resume-to-Job Matching system using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind CSS. The backend connects to a PostgreSQL database running inside a Docker container, ensuring easy setup and environment consistency. Resumes are matched to jobs based on shared skills using SQL logic. The frontend is built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for smooth interaction.
