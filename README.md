# Job-Parser

A simple Resume-to-Job Matching system using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind CSS. The backend connects to a PostgreSQL database running inside a Docker container, ensuring easy setup and environment consistency. Resumes are matched to jobs based on shared skills using SQL logic — no sentiment analysis or ML involved. The frontend is built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for smooth interaction.
